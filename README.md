### Warm Up
In this part we will take a first look at the datas by loading them inside a jupyter notebook. We will start by some basical Exploratory data Analysis
#### O1 Feb 2018
Cf Datacamp_roadmap_v1
### Dive in
#### 01 Feb 2018
We will consider a simple model receiving as input the counts of words and the counts of characters in text fields (cf Notebook) to predict the classes.
We started by predicting with some classical algorithm listed on the roadmap above.

##### Submissions
NDIAYE Mohamed: Random Forest Classifier <br/>
